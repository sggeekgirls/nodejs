Introduction to Web Applications with Node.js
=============================================

Learn the basics behind Node.js and write JavaScript on the server side. With nearly 30,000 stars on GitHub, node.js is one of the fastest growing web technologies today.

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Is this workshop for you?
-------------------------
The aim of this workshop is to get you started with developing web applications with Node.js. This is a great starting point for HTML/CSS developers to get their feet wet with developing on the backend!

What do I need to know to take this workshop?
---------------------------------------------
* Knowing some JavaScript will be definitively helpful. 
* Youâ€™ll need [Node.js]( http://nodejs.org/) on your computer. Then use npm (it comes with Node) to install modules.
* You will also need a Text Editor, if you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code. A few options: [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), [Textmate](http://macromates.com/download), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Atom](http://www.atom.io/.)
* And a [Github](https://github.com/join) account. There will be a small intro to git, so no [git](http://git-scm.com/) experience necessary.
